# CivUniversalis

CivUniversalis is a total conversion mod for Europa Universalis 4, heavily based on a Minecraft Civilization server called CivMC (see more: https://civmc.net/). Events, territories, etc are all based on the actual events that happened in the CivMC server, but there will have some fictions such as formable nation, decisions, mission trees, and more.

Currently this mod will contain only one timeline and it will be based on this Reddit post; https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1cz5wbw/civmc_unofficial_claims_map_27_changing_of_the/
